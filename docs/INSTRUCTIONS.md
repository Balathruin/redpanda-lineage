## How to Contribute to the Red Panda Lineage

To make contributions to this dataset, you'll need to learn about how Git works.


## Background: Why GitHub

GitHub and its related tools are used by software developers for managing software source code. Most GitHub public projects allow anyone with expertise to contribute fixes and updates back to the software they use. The key facet that makes this work is _Code Review_ -- project owners can review and communicate with contributors, allowing contributions to be revised and refined before they are merged into the main source code.

GitHub gives us an identification layer (contributors' user accounts) for free, and an entire platform for managing contributions. In our case, the source code is a dataset of Red Pandas, and the Zoos they live in.
